# frankie

my name is frankie and in the 10th grade, I was first exposed to HTML and CSS. I learned a lot in that class, but it wasn't until in college that I decided that I want to learn to program so I can become a programmer. I want to increase my knowledge of different languages and one day, I would like to work for Google as a software engineer.
